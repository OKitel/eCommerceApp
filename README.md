# Maestro Market

Welcome to our eCommerce musical instrument selling application!
This project is a simple e-commerce application powered by React on the frontend and CommerceTools platform for the backend. It's simply a demo demonstrating basic features which is only the tip of an iceberg because commerce is a complex business with a solid system architecture. Our application replicates real-world shopping experiences in a digital environment.

## Visitors can do the following

1. Browse through a vast range of music instruments, view their detailed descriptions and select an item from the showcase and preview.
2. Search, categorization and sorting of the instruments.
3. User registration and login to the further implementation of the order.
4. Add their favorite instruments to the cart and proceed to checkout.
